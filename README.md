# Gray

Gray is an oversimplified Python implementation of the core ideas of [Ray](https://ray.io/). It's
meant to be an educational tool and not a "real" implementation.

## Primary directives

- **Simplicity**: This allows us to focus on the main ideas of Ray and not get bogged down in
  details.
- **Production un-readiness**: There is a time and a place for "proper" practices; this is not one
  of them. There aren't going to be any tests. This isn't even going to be a Python package; just a
  bundle of scripts.
- **Incomplete implementation**: This is not going to exactly mirror Ray. Gray isn't going to handle
  any edge-cases. It's not even going to implement all of the core features.
